This tool augments the B3 bot with the possibility to log changes of the rights
of players (i.e. changes of the field group_bits in the table clients) if you
are using MySQL v5.0.2 or above.

There are two sql files. The first sql file table_create.sql creates a table
group_bits_log where you can see the changes of group_bits in the table
clients. The second file trigger_create.sql creates the triggers, which fill
the table group_bits_log.

Your mysql use must have the right to create new tables and triggers.

Let MYSQLUSER be your mysql user (for example root) and B3DB the database name
of the b3 database.

mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p B3DB < table_create.sql
mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p B3DB < trigger_create.sql

That's all.

If you want to know the group_bits changes of id 42 let's say, just go into
mysql client and type
select * from group_bits_log where client_id = 42 order by time;
